      envisioning a fool it would be embarrassing to return to a 10 year high school reunion with a different name to have to remind everyone. no one would remember thinking about coffee with X when he stopped spelling his name X what death closes off for a person I had a bad haircut then he told me X had died overdose. X struggling right now. I saw them in the hallway and they looked sickly wan X told us coming back. Maybe I shouldn’t be offering to help X to support them. I mean, afraid it could get caught in the shrapnel wondering how to build visions and foolishness into my work without being too on the nose how to play in Signal that I guess I already am but I need some other sort of guidance. I’m sure X’s journals will help me with that. I’m excited to be down there with them. I’m getting coffee with X soon. Doesn’t anyone want a poem of mine? a Simple measly poem. Weasel out my nose poems captured wonder if I’ll get to meet X, if X would introduce us though she seemed hesitant last time it got brought up. I’d like to get better at games to code a little and to read. I wish someone would teach me build it from scratch, sharing and fumbling for my retainer last night I’ve been wanting white strips. X is hoping to plan a meeting for the union I told X that she haunts my a’s with her comment about how theyrw j’s. I just write my J so differently. I shouldn’t worry too much about it. Groin throbbing with a morning desire want to go to visible records more this summer want to build a website actually I should have one you know maybe I’d pay five dollars a month for one shoes off comments recorded a walk well on the way to happening. It may be well taken. It wears your paddle surely soonly. taken out the back and then shot that’s we’re to assume anyways Peter Gabriel ebullient on iTunes on Spotify. Is Apple Music iTunes now? When will I be made to pay for the premium subscription? How will I keep track of all the passwords at some point it will fall to the CEOs I swear.
