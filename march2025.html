  <li>Dream (3.13): I've made an intricate carved fan. My dream father hates it; he wants to destroy it by lighting it on fire. I throw the bottle of kerosene to J and some of it gets on her shirt.</li>
  <li>Dream (3.17): At a store that's selling a book C made -- it's just an art book with holes cut out across the pages. The store is selling it for $150, and this makes me laugh.</li>
  <li>It was my birthday. S says I'm obsessed with my birthday. I think I might be, but I also don't think this is bad. I'm the age I've always been meant to be.</li>
