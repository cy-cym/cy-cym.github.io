         <h1>October!!</h1>
           <ul>
             <li>Finally read Cookie Mueller's collected stories,, that final letter it ends on made me cry, from Gordon Stevenson:
             <br> "All we really need is bread, water, love, and work that we enjoy and are good at, and an undying faith in and love of ourselves, 
                   our freedom, and our dignity. All that stuff is practically free, so how come it's so hard to get—and how come all these assholes and “professionals,” 
                   friends and foes, family and complete strangers are always trying to convince us to follow their dumb rules, give up work in order to be a client of theirs, 
                   give up our freedom and dignity to increase their power and control?...I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW that somewhere there is paradise and although I think it's really far away, 
                   I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW I'm gonna get there, and when I do, you're gonna be one of the first people I'll send a postcard to with complete description of, and map for locating … 
                   Courage, bread, and roses, Gordon</li>
                 <li>asemic writing -- could graffiti fit into this category</li>
                 <li>there is no equalizer, no equalizing event. ants get into our bathroom. A buys us a drain-stopper for the bigger bodies that will climb in anyways.</li>
                 <li>Kiss on the cheek // Bodies that climb in anyways</li>
                 <li>today i'm running on 5 hours of sleep, and s & i just had the most surreal experience with this dog we said we'd try to look after. we gave up about 5 hours in, 
                       and brought him back to his house -- his owner is away for an indefinite period of time. i've been thinking about m and all the different animals they would petsit for.
                      this man's house felt like a movie set, so specific that it seems like fiction. why is that. did media that depicts old single men's homes influence his decisions? or is that media just portraying something real & universal? 
                obviously i'm oversimpifying and obviously this is inane but i'm so tired and want to share with you. the house was full of dolls, puppets, one of those monkeys with cymbals, a marilyn monroe statue in her white dress with her cleavage really big. 
                 how can that be real? it's like what i think reality is is marilyn monroe the person, but what reality actually is is marilyn monroe the statue, you know? the dog got out from under the fence and i thought i was going to have a full meltdown, 
                       his little body lost in the dark on our busy road, this old man's fears come true. we got him back and dropped him off,
                 and i feel like my head and heart are picked over. i made curry today and the dog sat in my lap while i ate; i took a couple selfies with us positioned like this and thought of myself as someone who does something kind for a neighnor they've never met. 
                       a man at the hardware store told me the types of gloves he wore while working in an industrial freezer for hours at a time. 
                       i didn't buy what he suggested cause my job is not that intense. penny wants to go outside but i can't imagine letting another animal out into the night right now. i'm full of a very specific kind of fear i don't feel very often, 
                 it's sort of mixed with this perverse sense of gratitude. s & i hugged for a long time before she left about 20 minutes ago. </li>
