         <h1>April!!</h1>
           <ul>
  <li>Always trying to change the way I do things, like this</li>
  <li>Virginia Woolf x Inspector Gadget x Anne Carson</li>
  <li>Wet willy but it's a fern in my ear</li>
  <li>I want to create beyond what I know</li>
  <li>I'm going to stop sending weird emails</li>
  <li>"I would like / to give my / best / to all sentient / beings, / and before / I die, / I'd like / 
       to de-tox / my mind / and tame / delusion, / but we are not / in a time / appropriate / to do this." John Giorno </li>
  <li>Reading "The Waves" and somehow L knew and told me the speaker of my poems reminds her of Rhoda. I understand Rhoda the least.</li>
   <li>"Then suddenly descended upon me the obscure, the mystic sense of adoration, of completeness that triumphed over chaos. 
     Nobody saw my poised and intent figure as I stood at the open door. 
     Nobody guessed the need I had to offer my being to one god; and perish, and disappear." (31-32) Virginia Woolf </li>
  <li>"The human face is hideous. This is to my liking. I want publicity and violence and to be dashed like a stone on the rocks. 
            I like factory chimneys and cranes and lorries. I like the passing of face and face and face, deformed, indifferent. 
            I am sick of prettiness; I am sick of privacy." (105) Woolf</li>
