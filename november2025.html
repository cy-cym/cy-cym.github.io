         <h1>November!!</h1>
      <ul>
             <li>I wore a mask at the charlotte airport and wrote in my notes app underneath the Catawba trade sign and listened to stuff wondering if you heard what I heard. 
                   If u knew what I meant by stuff or if I did. What stuff betrays beneath the white sheet draped over the obvious couch. Obvious armoire. </li>
            <li>DO NOT RETURN TO THIS IN TRANQUIL REPOSE</li>
            <li>"I cannot consider stone without acknowledging that it is unfathomable, and this abyss of fullness, this night sheathed by eternal light, for me exemplifies the real." - Yves Bonnefoy</li>
                  <ul>
                        <li><i>Do Stones Dream?</i> <br>

Two hands pass over our face; <br>
they are sifting through the sun <br>
and the light moves like thrushes in tall grass, <br>
gold-black and whispering. <br> <br>

At night,<br>
the hands press orange into purple,<br>
and the thrushes grow still,<br>
give way to an ocean that remembers <br>
its dreams unto us.<br><br>

In the dim of sleep,<br>
the water impresses itself <br>
into the deep of the back of our eyes, <br>
etches dark figures <br>
which move with a warmth we cannot see. <br>
</li>
                        <li>^^ ... poem of mine from 2018... undercurrent resurfacing, same concerns that haunt us across time, touching a thread that a thousand others have traced, i wish we could talk about it</li>
                        <li>how only V knew what I was saying, how I miss them now</li>
                        <li>dark aloneness of November permeating, like being on winter break and going with my parents to the outlet mall</li>
                        <li>It's just really interesting that both me and Bonnefoy conceive(d) of the stone as an embodiment of total darkness meeting total light, how that meeting is what gives the stone its weight</li>
                        <li>Thinking too about Barbara Guest, ROCKS ON A PLATTER</li>
                  </ul>
