         <h1>December!!</h1>
      <ul>
            <li>My fear is boring so I climb inside it</li>
            <li>Blameless only because its ruined</li>
            <li>"all I got is time until the end of time".... I think Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell is such a genius album. I was listening to it around this time last year,
            and it feels good to come back around for a moment. It just makes me smile and shake my head to myself; thank god for these gestures we share with ourselves while we're doing the dishes,
            thank god for melodrama. All the snow in the backyard melted so that it's almost like it didn't happen except it did. That conundrum will get me through the rest of my life, which I hope is long.</li>
            <li>"To possess is to soil. To love purely is to consent to distance, it is to adore the distance between ourselves and that which we love." -Weil, GG 115</li>
            <li>I read Robert Gluck's Jack the Modernist last month, but I never recorded any of the quotes on here. I was reading them to people so much, I felt them in my heart
            so deeply. I scanned certain pages, imagined printing and sending them in a letter to __. My heart as this mine own og blog. </li>
            <li>This month I find I've been reconsidering how I record my life in these 'public' spheres -- I've been quiet, I'm afraid of what to say and how. Maybe not afraid, just a little dumnb. </li>
            <li>well anyways, now I'm reading Gluck's "Margary Kempe" and I don't like it as much. I like youth's bombastic play. I suppose I'm unrealistic. Just like how I have never gotten over
            the trip Rauschenburg and Twombly took to Morocco and Rome when they were, what, 23? </li>
      </ul>
