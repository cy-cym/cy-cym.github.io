X struggling right now. I saw them in the hallway and they looked sickly wan X told us coming back. Maybe I shouldn’t be offering to help X to support them. I mean, afraid it could get caught in the shrapnel wondering how to build visions and foolishness into my work without being too on the nose how to play in Signal that I guess I already am but I need some other sort of guidance. I’m sure X’s journals will help me with that. I’m excited to be down there with them. I’m getting coffee with X soon. Doesn’t anyone want a poem of mine? a Simple measly poem. Weasel out my nose poems captured wonder if I’ll get to meet X, if X would introduce us though she seemed hesitant last time it got brought up. I’d like to get better at games to code a little and to read. I wish someone would teach me build it from scratch, sharing and fumbling for my retainer last night I’ve been wanting white strips.
